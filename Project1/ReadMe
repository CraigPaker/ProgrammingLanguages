This project needed me to create a static clock which would accurately roll over when the added time exceeded 60 seconds/minutes; 
a distinction between morning and night was needed too. I felt that the way I implemented the use of conditional statements to account for seconds rolling into minutes, 
rolling into hours. However, the code could be enhanced by reading-in the current time; allowing the clock to function as a real clock. 
This would allow for additional functionality such as an alarm to be created and implemented. The most challenging part of this project was the creation of the user interface; 
done in console using C++ for this assignment. I had to look up different ways of formatting output in order to complete a user-friendly interface. 
I reused the border function to create borders in the UI through out the other projects in this course. If, in the future, 
I need to revisit this code to add a function such as an alarm it would be easy. This is because I left notes within my code, 
used functions, and wrote the code in a modular fashion.
